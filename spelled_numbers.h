/* These functions search the given string for sections containing
 * spelled out numbers like 'one hundred fifty thousand three hundred twelve'
 * and replace such sections with numeric equivalents, either in-place, or
 * in a new string.  So:
 *
 *    char x[] = "turn left forty five degrees and then set the throttle to ninety";
 *    printf("%s\n", handled_spelled_numbers_in_place(x));
 *
 * would print out:
 *
 *    turn left 45 degrees and then set the throttle to 90
 *
 * You do not want to use this code for anything where it is important
 * to actually get the correct answer, as it pretty hacky and it *will*
 * get a few cases wrong for sure.
