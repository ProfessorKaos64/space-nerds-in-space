.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  earthlike
From a given set of land-color, water-color, and heightmap input image
data, produces 6 images forming a cube map texture for an earth-like
planet.
.PP
It works as follows.  6 square arrays
of vectors representing heights are arranged in an over inflated cube.
A number of initial "bumps" are applied.  Each "bump" deforms the vector
field from it's initial sphere by making a "pimple" on the surface.  This
pimple is modulated by heightfield data sampled from a random portion
of the input heightmap data provided via the -h flag. This is repeated
over and over.  For each bump, smaller bumps are recursively added in
the same vicinity until the bumps become "too small" at which point the
recursion stops.  Once this process is complete, the vector field now
represents a sphere which has been deformed into something like terrain.
The altitude and sampled value of a 3d noise function are used to index
into the provide land-color and water-color images to determine a set of
output images forming terrain cubemap.  Additionally, heightmap and normal
map cubemaps are output.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-b, --bumps
Number of smaller bumps to recursively add to each bump.  Default is 3.
.TP
-B, --initialbumps
Number of initial bumps to add.  Default is 60.
.TP
-d, --dimension
Size of (square) output images in pixels.  Default is 1024 (for 1024x1024 images),
minimum is 128, maximum is 2048.
.TP
-h, --height
Name of file containing input heightmap data.  This should be an
8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced PNG image file.
.TP
-H, --heightmap-output
Prefix for name of 6 output heightmap png image files.
.TP
-k, --shrink
Factor by which to shrink "sub-bumps" relative to "bumps" in the recursive bump-adding
algorithm. Default value is 0.55.
.TP
-l, --land
Name of land color png input file. This should be an
8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced PNG image.
.TP
-n, --normal
Name of prefix to use for filenames of output normal map images.
.TP
-o, --output
Name of prefix to use for filenames of output terrain images.
.TP
-O, --oceanlevel
Value to use to determine sealevel.  Default is 0.08.
.TP
-r, --rlimit
Recursion limit specified as the smallest radius a bump is allowed to be
before the recursion is terminated.  Default is 0.005.
.TP
-s, --scatter
Bump scatter factor as a fraction of the radius of the bump.  Default is 1.5.
-S, --seed
Random seed to use.  Default is 31415.
-w, --water
Name of input file to use for water colors, shoudlbe an 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced PNG image file.
-z, --bumpsize
radius of initial bumps expressed as a multiplying factor of the planet radius.  Default value
is 0.04.
