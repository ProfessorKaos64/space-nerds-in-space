How to get speech recognition working with Space Nerds In Space
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install pocketsphinx on the client system to which the microphone you want to use is attached

(TODO: what are the steps?  "apt-cache search pocketsphinx" and then apt-get install ... something)

2. Create specialized language files for pocketsphinx from snis_vocab.txt

Go to http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html

Click the "BROWSE" button, and upload the snis_vocab.txt

Then click COMPILE KNOWLEDGE BASE

This will produce a number of files, including a gzipped tarball that contains
all the files.  Download the gzipped tarball which will be named something like
"TAR1234.tgz" (but probably different numbers than 1234).

3. Download and unpack the TAR1234.tgz, which should contain 5 other files:

1234.dic
1234.log_pronounce
1234.vocab
1234.lm
1234.sent

Copy these to this directory.

4. Run "queeg500"

$ queeg500 1234
